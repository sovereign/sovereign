h1. Introduction

Sovereign is a set of "Ansible":http://ansibleworks.com playbooks that you can use to build and maintain your own "personal cloud":http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clown%20computing (I know I know). It's based entirely on open source software, so you're in control.

If you've never used Ansible before, you a) are in for a treat and b) might find these playbooks useful to learn from, since they show off a fair bit of what the tool can do.

h2. Background and Motivations

I had been a paying Google Apps customer for personal and corporate use since the service was in beta. Until several weeks ago, that is. I was about to set up another Google Apps account for a new project when I stopped to consider what I would be funding with my USD $50 per user per year:

# "A seriously questionable privacy track record":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google#Privacy.
# "A dwindling commitment to open standards":https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging.
# "A lack of long-term commitment to products":http://www.quora.com/Google-Products/What-are-all-the-Google-products-that-have-been-shut-down.
# Development of Google+: a cynical and "unimaginative Facebook ripoff":http://gigaom.com/2012/03/15/google-plus-the-problem-isnt-design-its-a-lack-of-demand/ that's "intruding into progressively more Google products":http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/google-defending-google-plus-shares-usage-numbers/?_r=0.

To each her/his own, but personally I saw little reason to continue participating in the Google ecosystem. It had been years since I last ran my own server for email and such, but it's only gotten cheaper and easier to do so. Plus, none of the commercial alternatives I looked at provided all the services I was looking for.

Rather than writing up a long and hard-to-follow set of instructions, I decided to share my server setup in a format that you can more or less just clone, configure, and run. Ansible seemed like the most appropriate way to do that: it's simple, straightforward, and easy to pick up.

I've been using this setup for about a month now and it's been great. It's also replaced some non-Google services I used, saving me money and making me feel like I've got a little more privacy.

A big chunk of the initial version was inspired by "this post by Drew Crawford":http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/. Unlike Drew, my goal is not "NSA-proofing" email, just providing a reasonable alternative to Google Apps that isn't wildly insecure. If you need serious privacy and security (ex: for dissident activities), Sovereign might be useful as a starting point but will require additional work. Be careful out there.

Don't want one or more of the above services? Comment out the relevant role in @site.yml@. Or get more granular and comment out the associated @include:@ directive in one of the playbooks.

h1. Usage

h2. What You'll Need

# A VPS (or bare-metal server if you wanna ball hard). My VPS is hosted at "Linode":http://www.linode.com/?r=45405878277aa04ee1f1d21394285da6b43f963b. You'll probably want at least 512 MB of RAM between Apache, Solr, and PostgreSQL. Mine has 1024.
# "64-bit Debian 7":http://www.debian.org/ or an equivalent Linux distribution. (You can use whatever distro you want, but deviating from Debian will require more tweaks to the playbooks. See Ansible's different "packaging":http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/modules.html#packaging modules.)
# A wildcard SSL certificate. You can either buy one or self-sign if you want to save money.
# A "Tarsnap":http://www.tarsnap.com account with some credit in it. You could comment this out if you want to use a different backup service. Consider paying your hosting provider for backups or using an additional backup service for redundancy.

h2. Installation

h3. 1. Get a wildcard SSL certificate

Generate a private key and a certificate signing request (CSR):

bc. openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout roles/common/files/wildcard_private.key -out mycert.csr

Purchase a wildcard cert from a certificate authority, such as "Positive SSL":https://positivessl.com or "AlphaSSL":https://www.alphassl.com. You will provide them with the contents of your CSR, and in return they will give you your signed public certificate. Place the certificate in @roles/common/files/wildcard_public_cert.crt@.

Download your certificate authority's combined cert to @roles/common/files/wildcard_ca.pem@. You can also download the intermediate and root certificates separately and concatenate them together in that order.

Lastly, test your certificate:

bc. openssl verify -verbose -CAfile roles/common/files/wildcard_ca.pem roles/common/files/wildcard_public_cert.crt

h4. Self-signed SSL certificate

Purchasing SSL certs, and wildcard certs specifically, can be a significant financial burden. It is possible to generate a self-signed SSL certificate (i.e. one that isn't signed by a Certificate Authority) that is free of charge by nature. However, since a self-signed cert has no CA chain that can confirm its authenticity, some services might behave erratically when using such a certificate.

To create a self-signed SSL cert, run the following commands:

bc. openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout roles/common/files/wildcard_private.key -out mycert.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in mycert.csr -signkey roles/common/files/wildcard_private.key -out roles/common/files/wildcard_public_cert.crt
cp roles/common/files/wildcard_public_cert.crt roles/common/files/wildcard_ca.pem

h3. 2. Get a Tarsnap machine key

If you haven't already, "download and install Tarsnap":https://www.tarsnap.com/download.html, or use @brew install tarsnap@ if you use "Homebrew":http://brew.sh.

Create a new machine key for your server:

bc. tarsnap-keygen --keyfile roles/tarsnap/files/decrypted_tarsnap.key --user me@example.com --machine example.com

h3. 3. Prep the server

For goodness sake, change the root password:

bc. passwd

Create a user account for Ansible to do its thing through:

bc. useradd deploy
passwd deploy
mkdir /home/deploy

Authorize your ssh key if you want passwordless ssh login (optional):

bc. mkdir /home/deploy/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
nano /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 400 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown deploy:deploy /home/deploy -R

This account should be set up for passwordless sudo. Use @visudo@ and add this line:

bc. deploy  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

h3. 4. Configure your installation

Modify the settings in @vars/user.yml@ to your liking. If you want to see how they're used in context, just search for the corresponding string.

Setting @password_hash@ for your mail users is a bit tricky. You can generate one using "doveadm-pw":http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Tools/Doveadm/Pw.

bc. # doveadm pw -s SHA512-CRYPT
Enter new password: foo
Retype new password: foo
{SHA512-CRYPT}$6$drlIN9fx7Aj7/iLu$XvjeuQh5tlzNpNfs4NwxN7.HGRLglTKism0hxs2C1OvD02d3x8OBN9KQTueTr53nTJwVShtCYiW80SGXAjSyM0

Remove @{SHA512-CRYPT}@ and insert the rest as the @password_hash@ value.

Alternatively, if you don't already have @doveadm@ installed, Python 3.3 or higher on Linux will generate the appropriate string for you (assuming your password is @password@):

bc. python3 -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("password", salt=crypt.METHOD_SHA512))'

On OS X and other platforms the "passlib":https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/ package may be used to generate the required string:

bc. python -c 'import passlib.hash; print(passlib.hash.sha512_crypt.encrypt("password", rounds=5000))'

Same for the IRC password hash...

bc. # znc --makepass
[ ** ] Type your new password.
[ ?? ] Enter Password: foo
[ ?? ] Confirm Password: foo
[ ** ] Kill ZNC process, if it's running.
[ ** ] Then replace password in the <User> section of your config with this:
<Pass password>
        Method = sha256
        Hash = 310c5f99825e80d5b1d663a0a993b8701255f16b2f6056f335ba6e3e720e57ed
        Salt = YdlPM5yjBmc/;JO6cfL5
</Pass>
[ ** ] After that start ZNC again, and you should be able to login with the new password.

Take the strings after @Hash =@ and @Salt =@ and insert them as the value for @irc_password_hash@ and @irc_password_salt@ respectively.

Alternatively, if you don't already have @znc@ installed, Python 3.3 or higher on Linux will generate the appropriate string for you (assuming your password is @password@):

bc. python3 -c 'import crypt; print("irc_password_salt: {}\nirc_password_hash: {}".format(*crypt.crypt("password", salt=crypt.METHOD_SHA256).split("$")[2:]))'

On OS X and other platforms the passlib:https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/ package may be used to generate the required string:

bc. python -c 'import passlib.hash; print("irc_password_salt: {}\nirc_password_hash: {}".format(*passlib.hash.sha256_crypt.encrypt("password", rounds=5000).split("$")[2:]))'

For git hosting, copy your public key into place. @cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub roles/git/files/gitolite.pub@ or similar.

Finally, replace the TODOs in the file @hosts@. If your SSH daemon listens on a non-standard port, add a colon and the port number after the IP address.
In that case you also need to add your custom port to the task @Set firewall rules for web traffic and SSH@ in the file @roles/common/tasks/ufw.yml@.

h3. 5. Run the Ansible Playbooks

First, make sure you've "got Ansible 1.6+ installed":http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html#getting-ansible.

To run the whole dang thing:

bc. ansible-playbook -i ./hosts site.yml

To run just one or more piece, use tags. I try to tag all my includes for easy isolated development. For example, to focus in on your firewall setup:

bc. ansible-playbook -i ./hosts --tags=ufw site.yml

You might find that it fails at one point or another. This is probably because something needs to be done manually, usually because there's no good way of automating it. Fortunately, all the tasks are clearly named so you should be able to find out where it stopped. I've tried to add comments where manual intervention is necessary.

h3. 6. Set up DNS

If you've just bought a new domain name, point it at "Linode's DNS Manager":https://library.linode.com/dns-manager or similar. Most VPS services (and even some domain registrars) offer a managed DNS service that you can use for this at no charge. If you're using an existing domain that's already managed elsewhere, you can probably just modify a few records.

Create an @A@ records which point to your server IP for:
 * @example.com@
 * @mail.example.com@
 * @autoconfig.example.com@ (for email client automatic configuration)
 * @read.example.com@ (for wallabe)
 * @news.example.com@ (for selfoss)
 * @cloud.example.com@ (for owncloud)
 * @git.example.com@ (for cgit)

Create a @MX@ record for @example.com@ which assigns @mail.example.com@ as the domain's mail server.

To ensure your emails pass DKIM checks you need to add a @txt@ record. The name field will be @default._domainkey.EXAMPLE.COM.@ The value field contains the public key used by OpenDKIM. The exact value needed can be found in the file @/etc/opendkim/keys/EXAMPLE.COM/default.txt@ it'll look something like this:

bc. v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDKKAQfMwKVx+oJripQI+Ag4uTwYnsXKjgBGtl7Tk6UMTUwhMqnitqbR/ZQEZjcNolTkNDtyKZY2Z6LqvM4KsrITpiMbkV1eX6GKczT8Lws5KXn+6BHCKULGdireTAUr3Id7mtjLrbi/E3248Pq0Zs39hkDxsDcve12WccjafJVwIDAQAB

Set up SPF and reverse DNS "as per this post":http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/. Make sure to validate that it's all working, for example by sending an email to <a href="mailto:check-auth@verifier.port25.com">check-auth@verifier.port25.com</a> and reviewing the report that will be emailed back to you.

h3. 7. Miscellaneous Configuration

* Sign in to the ZNC web interface and set things up to your liking. It isn't exposed through the firewall, so you must first set up an SSH tunnel @ssh deploy@example.com -L 6643:localhost:6643@ and then proceed to http://localhost:6643 in your web browser.
* Sign into ownCloud to set it up. You should select postgresql as the configuration backend.
