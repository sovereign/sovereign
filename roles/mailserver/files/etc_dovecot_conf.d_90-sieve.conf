## Settings for the Sieve interpreter
##

# Do not forget to enable the Sieve plugin in 15-lda.conf and 20-lmtp.conf
# by adding it to the respective mail_plugins= settings.

# The Sieve interpreter can retrieve Sieve scripts from several types of
# locations. The default `file' location type is a local filesystem path
# pointing to a Sieve script file or a directory containing multiple Sieve
# script files. More complex setups can use other location types such as
# `ldap' or `dict' to fetch Sieve scripts from remote databases.
#
# All settings that specify the location of one ore more Sieve scripts accept
# the following syntax:
#
# location = [<type>:]path[;<option>[=<value>][;...]]
#
# If the type prefix is omitted, the script location type is 'file' and the 
# location is interpreted as a local filesystem path pointing to a Sieve script
# file or directory. Refer to Pigeonhole wiki or INSTALL file for more
# information.

plugin {
  # The location of the user's main Sieve script or script storage. The LDA
  # Sieve plugin uses this to find the active script for Sieve filtering at
  # delivery. The "include" extension uses this location for retrieving
  # :personal" scripts. This is also where the  ManageSieve service will store
  # the user's scripts, if supported.
  # 
  # Currently only the 'file:' location type supports ManageSieve operation.
  # Other location types like 'dict:' and 'ldap:' can currently only
  # be used as a read-only script source ().
  #
  # For the 'file:' type: use the ';active=' parameter to specify where the
  # active script symlink is located.
  # For other types: use the ';name=' parameter to specify the name of the
  # default/active script.
  sieve = file:~/sieve;active=~/.dovecot.sieve

  # The default Sieve script when the user has none. This is the location of a
  # global sieve script file, which gets executed ONLY if user's personal Sieve
  # script doesn't exist. Be sure to pre-compile this script manually using the
  # sievec command line tool if the binary is not stored in a global location.
  # --> See sieve_before for executing scripts before the user's personal
  #     script.
  #sieve_default = /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieve

  # The name by which the default Sieve script (as configured by the 
  # sieve_default setting) is visible to the user through ManageSieve. 
  #sieve_default_name = 

  # Location for ":global" include scripts as used by the "include" extension.
  #sieve_global =

  # The location of a Sieve script that is run for any message that is about to
  # be discarded; i.e., it is not delivered anywhere by the normal Sieve
  # execution. This only happens when the "implicit keep" is canceled, by e.g.
  # the "discard" action, and no actions that deliver the message are executed.
  # This "discard script" can prevent discarding the message, by executing
  # alternative actions. If the discard script does nothing, the message is
	# still discarded as it would be when no discard script is configured.
  #sieve_discard =

  # Location Sieve of scripts that need to be executed before the user's
  # personal script. If a 'file' location path points to a directory, all the 
  # Sieve scripts contained therein (with the proper `.sieve' extension) are
  # executed. The order of execution within that directory is determined by the
  # file names, using a normal 8bit per-character comparison.
  #
  # Multiple script locations can be specified by appending an increasing number
  # to the setting name. The Sieve scripts found from these locations are added
  # to the script execution sequence in the specified order. Reading the
  # numbered sieve_before settings stops at the first missing setting, so no
  # numbers may be skipped.
  #sieve_before = /var/lib/dovecot/sieve.d/
  #sieve_before2 = ldap:/etc/sieve-ldap.conf;name=ldap-domain
  #sieve_before3 = (etc...)

  # Identical to sieve_before, only the specified scripts are executed after the
  # user's script (only when keep is still in effect!). Multiple script
  # locations can be specified by appending an increasing number.
  #sieve_after =
  #sieve_after2 =
  #sieve_after2 = (etc...)

  # Which Sieve language extensions are available to users. By default, all
  # supported extensions are available, except for deprecated extensions or
  # those that are still under development. Some system administrators may want
  # to disable certain Sieve extensions or enable those that are not available
  # by default. This setting can use '+' and '-' to specify differences relative
  # to the default. For example `sieve_extensions = +imapflags' will enable the
  # deprecated imapflags extension in addition to all extensions were already
  # enabled by default.
  #sieve_extensions = +notify +imapflags

  # Which Sieve language extensions are ONLY available in global scripts. This
  # can be used to restrict the use of certain Sieve extensions to administrator
  # control, for instance when these extensions can cause security concerns.
  # This setting has higher precedence than the `sieve_extensions' setting
  # (above), meaning that the extensions enabled with this setting are never
  # available to the user's personal script no matter what is specified for the
  # `sieve_extensions' setting. The syntax of this setting is similar to the
  # `sieve_extensions' setting, with the difference that extensions are
  # enabled or disabled for exclusive use in global scripts. Currently, no
  # extensions are marked as such by default.
  #sieve_global_extensions =

  # The Pigeonhole Sieve interpreter can have plugins of its own. Using this
  # setting, the used plugins can be specified. Check the Dovecot wiki
  # (wiki2.dovecot.org) or the pigeonhole website
  # (http://pigeonhole.dovecot.org) for available plugins.
  # The sieve_extprograms plugin is included in this release.
  #sieve_plugins =

  # The separator that is expected between the :user and :detail
  # address parts introduced by the subaddress extension. This may
  # also be a sequence of characters (e.g. '--'). The current
  # implementation looks for the separator from the left of the
  # localpart and uses the first one encountered. The :user part is
  # left of the separator and the :detail part is right. This setting
  # is also used by Dovecot's LMTP service.
  #recipient_delimiter = +

  # The maximum size of a Sieve script. The compiler will refuse to compile any
  # script larger than this limit. If set to 0, no limit on the script size is
  # enforced.
  #sieve_max_script_size = 1M

  # The maximum number of actions that can be performed during a single script
  # execution. If set to 0, no limit on the total number of actions is enforced.
  #sieve_max_actions = 32

  # The maximum number of redirect actions that can be performed during a single
  # script execution. If set to 0, no redirect actions are allowed.
  #sieve_max_redirects = 4

  # The maximum number of personal Sieve scripts a single user can have. If set
  # to 0, no limit on the number of scripts is enforced.
  # (Currently only relevant for ManageSieve)
  #sieve_quota_max_scripts = 0

  # The maximum amount of disk storage a single user's scripts may occupy. If
  # set to 0, no limit on the used amount of disk storage is enforced.
  # (Currently only relevant for ManageSieve)
  #sieve_quota_max_storage = 0

  # The primary e-mail address for the user. This is used as a default when no
  # other appropriate address is available for sending messages. If this setting
  # is not configured, either the postmaster or null "<>" address is used as a
  # sender, depending on the action involved. This setting is important when
  # there is no message envelope to extract addresses from, such as when the
  # script is executed in IMAP.
  #sieve_user_email =

  # The path to the file where the user log is written. If not configured, a
  # default location is used. If the main user's personal Sieve (as configured
  # with sieve=) is a file, the logfile is set to <filename>.log by default. If
  # it is not a file, the default user log file is ~/.dovecot.sieve.log.
  #sieve_user_log =

  # Specifies what envelope sender address is used for redirected messages.
  # The following values are supported for this setting:
  #
  #   "sender"         - The sender address is used (default).
  #   "recipient"      - The final recipient address is used.
  #   "orig_recipient" - The original recipient is used.
  #   "user_email"     - The user's primary address is used. This is
  #                      configured with the "sieve_user_email" setting. If
  #                      that setting is unconfigured, "user_mail" is equal to
  #                      "recipient".
  #   "postmaster"     - The postmaster_address configured for the LDA.
  #   "<user@domain>"  - Redirected messages are always sent from user@domain.
  #                      The angle brackets are mandatory. The null "<>" address
  #                      is also supported.
  #
  # This setting is ignored when the envelope sender is "<>". In that case the
  # sender of the redirected message is also always "<>".
  #sieve_redirect_envelope_from = sender

  ## TRACE DEBUGGING
  # Trace debugging provides detailed insight in the operations performed by
  # the Sieve script. These settings apply to both the LDA Sieve plugin and the
  # IMAPSIEVE plugin. 
  #
  # WARNING: On a busy server, this functionality can quickly fill up the trace
  # directory with a lot of trace files. Enable this only temporarily and as
  # selective as possible.
  
  # The directory where trace files are written. Trace debugging is disabled if
  # this setting is not configured or if the directory does not exist. If the 
  # path is relative or it starts with "~/" it is interpreted relative to the
  # current user's home directory.
  #sieve_trace_dir =
  
  # The verbosity level of the trace messages. Trace debugging is disabled if
  # this setting is not configured. Possible values are:
  #
  #   "actions"        - Only print executed action commands, like keep,
  #                      fileinto, reject and redirect.
  #   "commands"       - Print any executed command, excluding test commands.
  #   "tests"          - Print all executed commands and performed tests.
  #   "matching"       - Print all executed commands, performed tests and the
  #                      values matched in those tests.
  #sieve_trace_level =
  
  # Enables highly verbose debugging messages that are usually only useful for
  # developers.
  #sieve_trace_debug = no
  
  # Enables showing byte code addresses in the trace output, rather than only
  # the source line numbers.
  #sieve_trace_addresses = no 
}
