       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent
       certain other features from working. The API to
       IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be
       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be
       resolved.


       ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

       If you wish to regain use of /select?qt=... style request handler
       dispatching, then first add handleSelect="true" to
       <requestDispatcher>. Then change the name of the request handler
       named "/select" to something else without a leading "/", such as
       simply "select" and add default="true" to it.

    <!-- Request Parsing

         These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
         those requests

         enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.
         SearchRequestHandler won't fetch it, but some others do.

         multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size of
         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.

         *** WARNING ***
         The settings below authorize Solr to fetch remote files, You
         should make sure your system has some authentication before
         using enableRemoteStreaming="true"

      -->

    <!-- If you include a <cacheControl> directive, it will be used to
         generate a Cache-Control header (as well as an Expires header
         if the value contains "max-age=")

         By default, no Cache-Control header is generated.

         You can use the <cacheControl> option even if you have set
         never304="true"
      -->
    <!--

    <!-- To enable Solr to respond with automatically generated HTTP
         Caching headers, and to response to Cache Validation requests
         correctly, set the value of never304="false"

         This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
         headers based on the properties of the Index.

         The following options can also be specified to affect the
         values of these headers...

         lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
         Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
         requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
         was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

         (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
         the never304="true" option)

       For processing Search Queries, the primary Request Handler
       provided with Solr is "SearchHandler" It delegates to a sequent
       of SearchComponents (see below) and supports distributed
       queries across multiple shards

         partitioning the index, independent of any user selected filtering
         that may also be desired (perhaps as a result of faceted searching).

         NOTE: there is *absolutely* nothing a client can do to prevent these
         "appends" values from being used, so don't use this mechanism
         unless you are sure you always want it.

         In this example, the facet.field and facet.query params would
         be fixed, limiting the facets clients can use.  Faceting is
         not turned on by default - but if the client does specify

         will be able to see counts for; regardless of what other

  <!-- Document Analysis Handler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalysisRequestHandler

       An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis
       process of provided docuemnts. This handler expects a (single)
       content stream with the following format:

       <docs>
         <doc>
           <field name="id">1</field>
           <field name="name">The Name</field>
           <field name="text">The Text Value</field>
         </doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         <doc>...</doc>
         ...
       </docs>

    Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the
    unique key. This key is used in the returned response to associate
    an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.

    Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports
    query analysis by sending either an "analysis.query" or "q"
    request parameter that holds the query text to be analyzed. It
    also supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to
    true, all field tokens that match the query tokens will be marked
    as a "match".

       <searchComponent name="stats"     class="solr.StatsComponent" />
       <searchComponent name="debug"     class="solr.DebugComponent" />

       Default configuration in a requestHandler would look like:

       <arr name="components">
         <str>query</str>
         <str>facet</str>

       </arr>

       If you register a searchComponent to one of the standard names,
       that will be used instead of the default.

       To insert components before or after the 'standard' components, use:

       <arr name="first-components">
         <str>myFirstComponentName</str>
       </arr>

       <arr name="last-components">
         <str>myLastComponentName</str>

       NOTE: The component registered with the name "debug" will
       always be executed after the "last-components"
